# CMPE 255 Data Mining Project - Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project was developed as part of the CMPE 255 Data Mining course under Prof. Dr. Gheorghi Guzun of San Jose State University. <br>

## Introduction

Credit card fraud happens in our day to day life. Especially with the pandemic situation many credit card companies face the issue of rising credit card fraud among their customers. The goal of this project is to explore various machine learning techniques and algorithms to predict these fraudulent credit card transactions. 

## Dataset

The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud 

## Task performed

1. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis in Credit_Card_Fraud_EDA.ipynb notebook. <br>
2. Performing preprocessing and sampling of the dataset in Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb notebook.<br>
3. Predicting Fraudulent vs. Legitimate Transactions and analysing various machine learning models <br> 

## Steps to run project 

1. Clone the repository into your local directory or download the zip file. <br>
2. Download dataset provided in the link above. We were not able to upload the dataset here because of its size. <br>
3. Use Google Colab to run this project. Google Colab GPU provides much faster performance. <br> 
4. Upload .ipynb files to Google Colab. <br>
5. Change Runtime type to "GPU" as we have models that took almost 3 hours totally to train. <br>
6. Upload the dataset to Colab by clicking on the "Files" icon provided on the left hand side panel.<br>
7. Execute the code in Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb to look at all models except for Neural Networks.<br>
8. Execute the code in Credit_Card_Fraud_EDA.ipynb to view the visualizations and data analysis.<br>
9. The code for neural networks is available in credit_card_neural_network.ipynb notebook.<br>
